            <h2>Live Performance</h2>
            <h3>I am a solo acoustic singer/songwriter/guitarist/harmonica player. I play all kinds of venues from coffee shops & cafes to tap rooms, bars, restaurants, wineries, house concerts, private parties, special events and more. I play an average of 30 shows per year with over 30 years of live performance experience.</h3>
            <h3>I perform a lively, inspiring blend of originals spanning classic rock/folk rock/Americana and some classic country. I also cover The Rolling Stones, Neil Young, Bob Dylan, The Band, The Allman Brothers and an array of familiar tunes in my own signature style.</h3>
            <h3>Check out some video performances of my original songs.</h3>
            <h3>I currently play solo acoustic with the option to add a hand drummer/percussionist at your request.</h3>
            <h3>Here is a short video montage of some popular songs that I cover.</h3>
            <ReactPlayer url={'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDe8o981R1s'}>covers promo video</ReactPlayer>
            <h3>Reasonable rates- I can provide live music for much less than a full band. I can bring my own p.a. or use your house system.</h3>
            <h3>If you have any cancellations, I would be happy to fill in pending availability.</h3>
            <h2>Studio Sessions</h2>
            <h3>I play electric guitar as well as acoustic. If you need a soulful, gritty, bluesy, rock lead guitar track on your song, I can handle it. Most of my years of experience were playing classic rock and blues in bar bands. I can also add vocals and some harmonica. I have recorded several studio projects including recording "In the distance", "Devotion" and "Where I'm From" myself in my home studio. Send me a mix of your basic tracks, I'll send you back a WAV file of guitar or vocal.</h3>
            <h3>"You did a great job", "you have increased my pride in the tune", "I've got some good comments on it" -Tom Engelhardt, Song for Bernard, Into the nothin'</h3>
            <h2>Music Licensing</h2>
            <h3>If you are interested in using my songs for Movie, TV, Commercials or if you are an artist looking to record one of my songs, I will listen to your offer.</h3>
